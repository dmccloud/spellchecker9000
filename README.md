# Spellchecker9000

Spellchecker9000 is a simple, yet powerful spell checking tool that uses a dictionary to verify the spelling of words in a text file.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd spellchecker9000`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` (Assuming Node.js and npm are already installed on your system)

## Usage

to run the spellchecker, use the following command:

```bash
./spellchecker9000.ts <path-to-dicitonary-file> <path-to-text-file>
```

e.g.

```bash
./spellchecker9000.ts dictionary.txt text.txt
```

(assuming the dictionary file is named `dictionary.txt` and the text file is named `text.txt` and both files are in the same directory as the `spellchecker9000.ts` file)
